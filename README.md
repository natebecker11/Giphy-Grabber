# Giphy-Grabber
A page with dynamically added buttons that display gifs

## Core Features
Users will be able to click on one of the buttons on the screen, and on doing so 10 gifs will be displayed related to that button's title. Each gif will be displayed alongside its rating. For example, clicking the 'dogs' button will show 10 dog gifs. Additionally, users can enter a term into a text box, then click a button to submit that term. This will create another button on the screen that will function similarly to the initial buttons.
